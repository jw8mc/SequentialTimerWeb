WHEN CREATING NEW TIMER >
IF at least one Anchor Timer exists
    prompt user to select existing Anchor Timer or create a new one
    IF create new anchor
        go create a new anchor
    ELSE
        check if anchor has associated sequence
        IF yes
            prompt to edit or delete existing sequence
            IF edit
                go edit existing sequence
            ELSE
                delete sequence, create new timer sequence
        ELSE
            create new timer sequence
ELSE
    create new anchor

CREATE NEW ANCHOR >
Use form to collect data, populate object, call create function in DAO

EDIT EXISTING TIMER >
Populate form with existing data by calling read function in DAO
Let user name changes and submit form
On submit, update timer object and call update function in DAO

CREATE TIMER SEQUENCE >
Pick anchor (existing or new)
    Create TimerSequence object with AnchorTimer id and user id
Add sequential timer (existing or new)
    Create sequence details object - first sequential timer has preceeding timer id of 0
    Store sequential timer id as variable to use for next timer
Add another sequential timer
    Create sequence details object with preceeding timer id being that of previously added timer
    Store this timer's id as before
Repeat until done
When done, run sequenceDetailDAO method to get all records matching the new timer sequence id, get count of these records,
    assign to timer sequence # of timers field

EDIT TIMER SEQUENCE >
IF deleting sequential timer
    save preceeding timer id from timer to be deleted
    edit timer that follows deleted timer to have preceeding timer id that the deleted timer had
IF adding sequential timer
    get preceeding timer id from timer that will follow the new sequential timer
    set new timer's preceeding timer id to be that one
    loop through rest of timer sequence and repeat id reassignment

DELETE ANCHOR TIMER >
Prompt to reassign timer sequence to new anchor
Otherwise delete anchor timer, delete timer sequence, delete all sequence details from that timer sequence

DELETE SEQUENTIAL TIMER >
Prompt to reassign to different sequential timer
IF reassign
    FOR ALL SEQUENCES THAT USE THIS TIMER (via sequence detail dao method)
    new timer gets preceeding timer id from old timer
    following timer gets new timer's id as preceeding timer id
IF delete
    FOR ALL SEQUENCES THAT USE THIS TIMER (via sequence detail dao method)
    formerly following timer gets assigned timer-to-be-deleted's preceeding timer id
