##Status Report - Week 11

1. Made some changes to database structure to un-complicate it. Added a primary key to the Sequence_Details table, since having a three-part compound key was probably a bad choice.
1. At the risk of having even more on my already-overloaded plate, I want to try deploying this to an actual server, which means securing the database and a whole host of other steps. Something to learn, I guess.
1. Continuing to be frustrated with the lack of sensible documentation for Google APIs. Everything is Gradle-this and Gradle-that. Not particularly helpful.
