##Status Report - Week 9

1. After being very thoroughly frustrated with Swing, I decided to see how long it would take to replicate my design - as it existed in Swing at that moment - in a JSP with Bootstrap. The answer was under 30 minutes. Pretty discouraging.
1. I did nothing else this week. I was feeling really overwhelmed with how far behind I'd let myself get with this project, frustrated and discourage with the layout and how focused I'd gotten on it, and it was my first week working at 7 am Monday through Thursday.
