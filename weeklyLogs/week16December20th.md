##Status Report - Week 16 (or, the last week)

1. I made it all work.
But seriously, this project has really shown me that I am not good at managing my time, nor at properly planning what steps I need to take to reach my end goal.
Having a nebulous idea of an end point is not the same as having a concrete plan, and that's definitely something I struggled with this semester.
On a basic level, my project performs the functions it should. It's not polished, it doesn't feel done, and I'm not satisfied with it. But it's the most complex project I've ever attempted and the fact that I got as much working as I did is pretty cool, in my opinion.
