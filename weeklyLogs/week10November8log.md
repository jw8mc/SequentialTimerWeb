##Status Report - Week 10

1. Officially giving up on using Swing and creating a desktop application. Falling back to my very first programming mantra of "make it work, then make it pretty." I'll get the base functionality working in a web app and look at porting it later.
1. Did a test app to connect to Google Calendar and OAuth2. Pretty simple to integrate into a web app, so I should be able to get the Calendar column working. Also found Google's Task API, might look at replacing what was going to be a self-built tasks column with that API.
1. At this point, I'll ammend my original goals to have Google Calendar and Task API integration, but to ensure usability I should eventually build my own calendar and task classes, for use when someone doesn't have or want to use Google.
