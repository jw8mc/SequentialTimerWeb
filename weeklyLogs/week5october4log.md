##Status Report - Week 5

1. Sketched some UI design on paper. Likely looking at a 2-3 column view. Will try to make a wireframe or similar this coming week.
1. Read into Swing framework, and given that I want to eventually take this multi-platform it looks like Swing will be a good fit.
1. After deciding Swing is probably the way to go, I read into AWT to cover my bases. Still leaning towards Swing.
